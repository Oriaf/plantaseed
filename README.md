# Seed

Seed is a game about the journey of a small seed to find a place for it to sprout. It  is a single player 3D navigation-action game, in which the player guides the seed along its journey to the center of a planet. Along the way, the player must traverse multiple layers of the planet, making use of the ability to reverse the gravitational forces to navigate to the next layer. On the path, the seed meets obstacles and hardship. To get to the center of the planet, it has to get through the gates on each layer by collecting keys that have been lost around in the different layers. However, the seedâ€™s energy supply is in danger, and thus the player must stay active and think quickly to survive the journey!

But! It's not only surviving that matters, the player has to be quick to beat its previous run and other playing friends. The quickest player gets to be on the top of the list, a real MVP.

The development of the game Seed was part of the course DH2650 Computer Game Design at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Further information on the game can be found on its webpage.
